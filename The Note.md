Results:
	After demonstrating the proper use of chloroform as a solvent in the production of certain chamicals needed in the LAHS Chemistry labs + observing all of the chemistry teachers replicating the process, I have determined that all but 1 are capable of performing the procedure + can keep their jobs. I will stay after school to clean up the hood where the demo was performed.
